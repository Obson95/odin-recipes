    <h4>Picture of a Well Prepared Tasso Kabrit</h4>
    <P>Tassot Cabrit (Fried Goat Meat) is one of the leading dishes in Haitian cuisine. Prepared with a few simple ingredients, the tender and juicy, crisp, and golden meat pieces are delicious alongside pikliz, Haitian Black Rice, fried plantains, or as part of your Fritay</P>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg of goat meat (shoulder), (cut into 1 to 3 cm cubes)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of shallots, (chopped)</li>
        <li>3/4 cups of orange juice</li>
        <li>1 large onion, (chopped)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 to 8 garlic cloves, (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 green and 1 red bell peppers, (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 cup of bitter orange and lemon juice</li>
        <li>Grinded cloves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            One day prior to cooking your meat, put all ingredients except the oil in a large pot; add water if the amount of juice is insufficient to cover the meat and allow the marinade to sink in overnight in the refrigerator.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the mixture and allow the meat pieces to dry a little.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small pot, add the oil and fry the goat until it is dark on the outside yet tender on the inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A little piece of advice:</strong> As goat meat is usually very tender, it does not need to be boiled prior to frying. However when substituting beef for goat, your meat might need to be pre-cooked (boiling) before the frying step.
